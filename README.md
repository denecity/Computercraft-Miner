# Computercraft-Miner
Fully automatic, chunkloading stripminer

This program will mine a 1x2 tunnel to infinity as long as it is provided enough enderpearls for chunkloading.
It will detect ores and mine the whole vein. It will mine every block with the string "ore" in its name.
It will output every block it mines in the outpuit Ender Chest.

## How to
- You can use any Mining Turtle
- Put coal in slot 1 (small amounts of coal are usually enough, as they are just needed for a kickstart)
- Put the output EnderStorage Ender Chest in slot 13 (you have to suck the items out of the Ender Chest quickly or the turtle will malfunction)
- Put the EnderStorage Ender Chest filled with enderpearls in slot 16 (you need about 1 pearl every 2 hours)
- Put a Railcraft Standard Worldspike in slot 14
- Put a Railcraft Standard Worldspike in slot 15
- Type "pastebin get p9VBT651 miner" in the turtle console
- Type miner to start the program (it will mine the bock directly below it, so be mindful of that)
